README

Created by Scott Atkins, 2006.  Updated 2016.


HOW TO PLAY:  

1)  Make sure your computer is set at 1024x768 or higher resolution.  The higher the better.
2)  Control your player with the arrow keys.  Attack a monster by moving towards them.  
3)  The goal is to defeat the four dragons placed on the map.  To do this, you have to work your way slowly up by defeating easier monsters first and getting better equipment.  

Good luck!
